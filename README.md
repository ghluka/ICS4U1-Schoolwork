# 🎓 ICS4U1 Schoolwork

This repository contains all the code I've written for my grade 12 computer science course. It does not include any lessons or assignments, just the solutions.

Due to the nature of the course, we can only use the knowledge taught (see the bottom for concepts learned in each unit) in this course and [last year's ICS3U1](https://github.com/ghluka/ICS3U1-Schoolwork).

## 📂 Terminology and File Structure

- ### 💪 Warmups

The `warmups` directory contains all solutions to problems given by the teacher to solve. These aren't worth marks but to practice our skills learned in class.

- ### 🏋️ Exercises

The `exercises` directory contains all warmups that were to be optionally submitted to the teacher for feedback.

- ### 📜 Tasks

The `tasks` directory contains all evaluations worth marks that were done online. 

These did not include tests as those were done on paper.

- #### 🧪 Testers

Testers are the programs provided by the teacher for running the functions created in each test. Most testers were incomplete on purpose, with "TODO" messages left by the teacher to implement.

Testers were to be submitted alongside the functions, with the modifications by students being worth marks.

- #### 📦 Blocks

Units are referred to as blocks in this course.

## 🎓 Blocks

All the different blocks and their respective concepts learned.
